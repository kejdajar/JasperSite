# JasperSite
JasperSite is a web content management system built on top of ASP.NET Core MVC, designed and implemented by Ing. Jaromír Kejda. 

This project is a part of his master's thesis: _Design and Implementation of Content Management System in ASP.NET Core_.
This master's thesis was successfully defended in 2018, Czech University of Life Sciences and supervised by Ing. Jiří Brožek, Ph.D., Department of Information Engineering.

## Legacy branch
__This branch contains the exact version of JasperSite that was published together with the master's thesis. This branch is, therefore, no longer subject of further updates.__ 

## Supported languages
Understandably, the source code of this program is written and commented in English. Unfortunately, the ADMIN section of the CMS supports only _Czech Language_. For additional languages and further info, please refer to the main development branch. 

## History
Although the beginning of this project is dated 8/8/2017, an older preparatory version of this CMS was used as its foundation.
The major part of this old version built on ASP.NET MVC was rewritten and the whole project was ported to ASP.NET Core MVC. On 5/9/2018 the CMS (formerly known as __JasperSiteCore__) was renamed to shorter __JasperSite__. Later on, the whole project was upgraded to .NET Core 2.1.
